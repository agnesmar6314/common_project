        <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

        <h2>Shrimp Scampi</h2>
        <img src="images/shrimp scampi.jpg" alt ="Shrimp scampi is a classic Italian-American delight, where succulent shrimp meet a medley of garlic, butter, and white wine. Sautéed to pink perfection, the shrimp mingle with a fragrant blend of garlic and red pepper flakes. A drizzle of white wine and a squeeze of lemon create a luxurious sauce, embracing the dish's linguine base. With a sprinkle of parsley, it's a harmonious, flavorful masterpiece that exemplifies both simplicity and taste.
        "/>
        <p> Recipe Ingredients </p>
        <p> 2 tablespoons butter
            2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
            4 garlic cloves, minced
            ½ cup dry white wine or broth
            ¾ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
            ⅛ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
            Freshly ground black pepper
            1¾ pounds large or extra-large shrimp, shelled
            ⅓ cup chopped parsley
            Freshly squeezed juice of half a lemon
            Cooked pasta or crusty bread </p>
            <p> Recipe Steps </p>
            <p> In a large skillet, melt butter with olive oil. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine or broth, salt, red pepper flakes and plenty of black pepper and bring to a simmer. Let the wine reduce by half, about 2 minutes. Add shrimp and sauté until they just turn pink, 2 to 4 minutes depending upon their size. Stir in the parsley and lemon juice and serve over pasta or accompanied by crusty bread.
